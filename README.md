# Project Name
0x11. C - printf
## Author Details
1. Antony Wainaina

## Requirements
Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs.
All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, using the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89.
Your code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl.
All your files should end with a new line.
You are not allowed to use global variables.
No more than 5 functions per file.
Note that we will not provide the _putchar function for this project.
The main.c files are used to test your functions, but you donâ€™t have to push them to your repo.
The prototypes of all your functions should be included in your header file called main.h.
All your header files should be include guarded.

### Project Description
Write your own printf function. _printf is a custom implementation of the C programming function printf. This project is an application of the C programming knowledge that ALX School cohort 5 students have learned since starting the program on February 2022. Below are examples of how to use it:

String

Input: _printf("%s\n", 'This is a string.');
Output: This is a string.
Character

Input: _printf("The first letter in the alphabet is %c\n", 'A');
Output: The first letter in the alphabet is A
Integer

Input: _printf("There are %i dozens in a gross\n", 12);
Output: There are 12 dozens in a gross
Decimal:

Input: _printf("%d\n", 1000);
Output: 1000
Compilation
Your code will be compiled this way.
$ gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89 *.c
Your code will be compiled as shown above.
As a consequence, be careful not to push any c file containing a main function in the root directory of your project (you could have a test folder containing all your tests files including main functions).
Our main files will include your main header file (main.h): #include main.h.
You might want to look at the gcc flag -Wno-format when testing with your _printf and the standard printf.
